## About The Project
Even though Carbon Emissions have been placed under the microscope in recent years, there is still a dearth of accesible tools with personalised guidance for individuals to track and reduce their Carbon Footprint. With Carbon Consciousness only becoming more in vogue as time passes, we want to help you consolidate your efforts in fighting climate change. Ecolibrium has provided the perfect service to analyze and help you achiev your sustainabilty goals.

Here's why:
* We quantify each action in your month in terms of emissions and give you the hard numbers of your progress.
* Based on your responses, we provide personalized suggestions to improve your carbon footprint
* We provide a one stop interface for many sustainabilty related needs for you.

This project aims aims to contribute to the United Nations Sutainable Development Goals

* SDG 12: Ensuring `sustainable consumption and production` patterns, which is key to sustain the livelihoods of current and future generations
* SDG 13: To take urgent `climate action` to combat global warming and its impacts
